I found the first key by going to "10.10.54.213/robots.txt" and then "http://10.10.54.213/key-1-of-3.txt"
I also downloaded the dictionary that was showed on the robots page by going to the fsocity.dic directory 
key 1:073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9
After this I runned gobuster with a common wordlist for directories I found /wp-login and decided to take a look I tried to login with a random username and password, I noticed that it showed a particular error for the username saying it was not found.
Since this is a mr.robot themed CTF I tried Elliot for the username and see if it gave me a password failed error instead, this worked!.
I then used the previous download dictionary and runned this command:
hydra -l Elliot -P /home/exzh/Downloads/fsocity.dic 10.10.54.213 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PWD^:The password you entered for the username" -t 30
With this I got the password "ER28-0652" and was able to login with the credentials
I then started to look for ways to upload a revershell on the server. I noticed that we could edit the appearance on the website, and edited the 404.php page to host a php reverse shell for me.
I copied a php reverse shell from github set up netcat and the shell to listen on port 3333 and my ip address and voilÃ¡!
After this I typed:
cd home/robot
cat key-2-of-3.txt
I didnt have permissions to open this file but I had the permissions to open the other file called password.raw-md5
I then proceeded to use john the ripper to crack this hash and got the password for the robot user:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Since we did not have an interactive shell we need to upgrade to one running:
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
Then switched to the user robot by using the password and was finally able to read the txt file:
cat key-2-of-3.txt
and got 
822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959
After this I ran find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null to see what was I able to run as sudo, I noticed nmap and went to gtfobins to look for ways to escalate priviliges using nmap.
nmap --interactive
!sh
After this it was only a matter of going to the root directory and run 
cat key-3-of-3.txt
